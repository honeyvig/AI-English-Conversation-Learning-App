This should provide you with a rough estimate of the project scope, costs, and timeline for the AI English Learning App.
To build an AI-powered English Conversation Learning App with the specified features, we'll break down the Python code into manageable modules. Below is a simplified version of the application logic, showcasing how to implement some of the key features, such as Google account authentication, lesson management, AI chatbot integration, and speech recognition for pronunciation analysis.
1. Google Account Authentication and Email Registration

We'll implement authentication using OAuth 2.0 for Google login and bcrypt for password storage. This will be handled in the backend.

First, ensure you have the required libraries installed:

pip install Flask Flask-OAuthlib bcrypt google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2

Backend Code (Flask API)

import os
from flask import Flask, request, redirect, jsonify, session
from flask_oauthlib.client import OAuth
import bcrypt
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import Flow
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = os.urandom(24)

# Google OAuth setup
oauth = OAuth(app)
google = oauth.remote_app(
    'google',
    consumer_key=os.getenv('GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'),
    consumer_secret=os.getenv('GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET'),
    request_token_params={
        'scope': 'email',
    },
    base_url='https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/',
    request_token_url=None,
    access_token_method='POST',
    access_token_url='https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token',
    authorize_url='https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth',
)

# Mock database (replace with real DB in production)
users_db = {}

@app.route('/login')
def login():
    return google.authorize(callback=url_for('authorized', _external=True))

@app.route('/logout')
def logout():
    session.pop('google_token')
    return redirect('/')

@app.route('/login/authorized')
def authorized():
    response = google.authorized_response()
    if response is None or response.get('access_token') is None:
        return 'Access denied: reason={} error={}'.format(request.args['error_reason'], request.args['error_description'])

    session['google_token'] = (response['access_token'], '')
    user_info = google.get('userinfo')
    user = user_info.data
    user_email = user['email']

    # Store user info in mock DB
    if user_email not in users_db:
        users_db[user_email] = {"name": user['name'], "email": user_email}

    return jsonify(users_db[user_email])

@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])
def register():
    username = request.json.get('username')
    password = request.json.get('password')

    hashed_pw = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt())

    users_db[username] = {"password": hashed_pw}
    return jsonify({"message": "User registered successfully"})

@app.route('/login_with_email', methods=['POST'])
def login_with_email():
    username = request.json.get('username')
    password = request.json.get('password')

    user = users_db.get(username)

    if user and bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode('utf-8'), user['password']):
        return jsonify({"message": "Login successful"})
    else:
        return jsonify({"message": "Invalid credentials"}), 401

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

In this code:

    Google OAuth: We authenticate the user using Google and store user details in a mock database (users_db).
    Email-Based Registration: We use bcrypt to hash passwords and save them securely.
    Login: We allow users to log in with either their Google account or email-based login.

2. Learning Content Delivery Features

For delivering scenario-based lessons, we can define content in the database (FireStore or PostgreSQL) and allow the user to navigate through scenarios.

# Mock database for content (could be Firebase or PostgreSQL in real app)
lessons_db = {
    'restaurant_order': {
        'difficulty': 'beginner',
        'content': 'Scenario: Ordering food at a restaurant. Phrases to use...',
        'audio_url': 'audio_file.mp3',
    },
    'business_meeting': {
        'difficulty': 'intermediate',
        'content': 'Scenario: Attending a business meeting. Key phrases...',
        'audio_url': 'audio_file.mp3',
    },
}

@app.route('/lesson/<lesson_id>')
def get_lesson(lesson_id):
    lesson = lessons_db.get(lesson_id)
    if lesson:
        return jsonify(lesson)
    else:
        return jsonify({"message": "Lesson not found"}), 404

In this code:

    Scenario-Based Lessons: Users can access lessons based on categories like "restaurant order" or "business meetings".
    Difficulty Levels: Lessons are categorized by difficulty (beginner, intermediate, advanced).
    Audio for Pronunciation Practice: Audio links are provided for listening exercises.

3. AI Chatbot Integration for Conversation Practice

To integrate an AI-powered chatbot that interacts with the user using GPT-4, we’ll use the OpenAI API (you'll need an API key from OpenAI).

Install OpenAI's library:

pip install openai

AI Chatbot Code

import openai

openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    user_input = request.json.get('message')

    if user_input:
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine="text-davinci-003",  # Or another GPT model
            prompt=user_input,
            max_tokens=150
        )
        return jsonify({"response": response.choices[0].text.strip()})
    return jsonify({"message": "No input provided"}), 400

In this code:

    AI Chatbot: The user sends a message, and the app responds using OpenAI's GPT-3/4 model.
    Guided Questions: You can modify the prompt to provide grammar or vocabulary-focused conversations.

4. Pronunciation Scoring (Using Google Speech-to-Text API)

For pronunciation practice, you can use Google's Speech-to-Text API to analyze the user's pronunciation.

First, install the necessary libraries:

pip install google-cloud-speech

Set up authentication using your Google Cloud account and configure credentials.
Pronunciation Scoring Code

from google.cloud import speech
import io

# Initialize client
client = speech.SpeechClient()

@app.route('/pronunciation', methods=['POST'])
def pronunciation():
    audio_file = request.files['audio']
    audio_content = audio_file.read()

    audio = speech.RecognitionAudio(content=audio_content)
    config = speech.RecognitionConfig(
        encoding=speech.RecognitionConfig.AudioEncoding.LINEAR16,
        sample_rate_hertz=16000,
        language_code="en-US",
    )

    response = client.recognize(config=config, audio=audio)

    # Assuming a simple model to return pronunciation feedback
    for result in response.results:
        transcript = result.alternatives[0].transcript
        # Basic feedback mechanism (this could be improved with AI)
        if "R" in transcript:
            feedback = "Good job with the 'R' sound!"
        else:
            feedback = "Try practicing the 'R' sound more."

    return jsonify({"transcript": transcript, "feedback": feedback})

In this code:

    Google Speech-to-Text: Converts the user's speech to text.
    Pronunciation Feedback: Simple feedback based on the presence of certain sounds (like "R").

5. Progress Visualization and Goal Setting

You can use a simple progress tracker with visual feedback, utilizing matplotlib or integrating with a frontend JS library like Chart.js for visual representation.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from io import BytesIO

@app.route('/progress')
def get_progress():
    proficiency = 80  # Example data
    total_learning_hours = 30  # Example data

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.barh(['Proficiency'], [proficiency])
    ax.set_xlim(0, 100)

    buf = BytesIO()
    fig.savefig(buf, format='png')
    buf.seek(0)

    return send_file(buf, mimetype='image/png')

This code generates a simple graph showing the user's progress (proficiency and learning hours). The frontend can render it as an image.
6. Subscription Management & Push Notifications

You can integrate Apple and Google Play subscription APIs into your mobile app. For push notifications, you can use Firebase Cloud Messaging.

pip install firebase-admin

Push Notifications Code

import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials, messaging

# Initialize Firebase app
cred = credentials.Certificate("path/to/your/firebase/credentials.json")
firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)

@app.route('/send_push', methods=['POST'])
def send_push_notification():
    message = messaging.Message(
        notification=messaging.Notification(
            title="Learning Reminder",
            body="Time to practice your English!"
        ),
        topic='user123',  # Targeted user
    )

    response = messaging.send(message)
    return jsonify({"message": "Push notification sent", "response": response})

This code sends a push notification to a specific user.
Conclusion

This Python-based backend solution gives you a foundation for the features requested in your AI English Conversation Learning App. You'll need to integrate it with a frontend mobile framework like Flutter or React Native and use a real database (e.g., Firebase Firestore or PostgreSQL) for production.

    Google Authentication: Done via OAuth.
    Password Management: Handled using bcrypt.
    AI Chatbot: Integrated using OpenAI's GPT API.
